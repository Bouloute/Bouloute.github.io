##### Since childhood
One of my earliest memories is of my father preparing a suprise for us on the brand new computer that he built. This was the early 2000s and in our neighborhood we might've been the only ones with a personal computer. My father is... well... a nerd. He's book smart and loves challenges and puzzles so when we got the computer one of the first things he did for me and my siblings was naturally to create a game. It's was a pretty simple one but for my 5yo self it was so awesome to be able to play a game made by your own dad! The goal was to type in the alphabet as fast as possible. We had some upgrade requests that he was happy to oblige.
Things like:  
* A time penalty if you typed in the wrong letter 
* A score board
* A game mode letting us write our favorite Harry Potter quotes instead of the alphabet
* A game mode making it a two player game where player 1 gets to chooses what player 2 types 

I could go on and on. Imagination doesn't lack in a child's brain so imagine 3 !
That's when I understood that you could personalise anything if you just learnt how and I distinctvely remember thinking that I wanted to learn such an awesome skill! Think of all the games I could make!

#### Early teen's awkwardness
I would mention skyblog and how much fun it was to learn how to make the most coloufull blog posts but let's just not go there.
I did get an Arduino board for my birthday and had plenty of fun with it makeing usless LED blink to the rythm of my favorite song. (Toxicity from System Of A Down) A **LOT** of time *well spent* as you can imagine.

#### Even today
A few years later I still use my arduino on projects today! 
My WIP project is making an Underwater Vehicle with my Husband who is an Ocean Engineer. He's doing the mechanic side and I'm making it move with an xbox controller for now. An Android app to control and receive data realtime is a thought I would love to complete!

#### Passing it down 
I have a big gap between me and my younger siblings. My littlest brother and I have an 11 year gap.  My little sister and I have a 9 year gap and she's a wonderfull artist and gets lost in books. My brother got his math senses from Dad. He always had a brilliant logical mind, too brilliant for his own good I would say. I might be biased... I introduced them both to [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/), she would desgin the games and he would "write" the code, they barely needed my help at all. They got really creative and it reminded me of that alphabet game and I wonder how much I would've loved Scratch if it had existed back then. I even got him a robot that was programable with Scratch for his birthday. My dad spent more time with it than my brother. Funny how people never change
