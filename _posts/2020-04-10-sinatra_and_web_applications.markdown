### Loving the Ruby labs and Project

I had a little too much fun with Ruby and was sad too finish the labs. Having already work expericences with OOP languages, it came as no suprise that being familiar and comfortable with the language, I was having a lot of fun flying through the labs. Even the project, I kept adding uneccesary layers because I had finished in a few hours and was bored.

These labs had me realise that one thing I know for sure is how much I've missed coding and  I absolutly love programming. 

### Scared about web applications

I got to admit, Web design has never been my forte.  That's why I made sure to specialise in OOP languages by accepting internships and jobs that fit that discription. But my experience with them only made me think that web applications are the furture of software. imagine a world where you don't have to wait 3 hours before downlading a heavy software, or borrowing a friends computer only to realise you can't use any of the software that you have and use because none of them are installed in this computer. 

More and more applications are turning to a web approch. As an example, I take my notes using a software that is linked to my email. I can access the notes though a web browser.

The stress of this new module comes from the fact that I've never heard of Sinatra before. To manage my stress I've been telling myself that most of the people taking this course with me have never heard of most of the things we will learn, but this has only worked in claming myself in the short term. 

I've never enjoyed learning how to create a website mostly because I didn't want to take the time to learn and understand when I already was spending time on OOP languages.

### Loving the Sinatra labs

So I finaly started the Sinatra labs after putting it off and doing some of the bonus HTML labs. I was planning on working an hour that day... ***5 hours later*** I only stopped because it's almost midnight.

Turns out, I was afraid for nothing. Flatiron has the labs increase slowly in difficulty and really makes sure the base is set before moving forward. It is impressivley well written and the progress I made was much more than I thought I could even acheive in so little time. 

And guess what... I'm enjoying learning about Sinatra and I'm even looking forward to the Project!
