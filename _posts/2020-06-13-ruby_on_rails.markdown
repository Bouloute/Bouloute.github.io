### Creating the proper schema

Ah the fear of the blank page. I really wanted to do a Hockey related project as my first two projects were for two reasons: 
<ul>
<li>1) I'm now very familliar with the subject and don't need to break my brain figuring out the database and what relations every object has with one another, etc...
<li>2) I'm absolutely terrified of the blank page. Give me the idea and I'll make you what you asked for, but tell me I can do what I want and I'll spend days figuring out what to do.
</ul>
I've felt very unoriginal because all the concepts I was coming up with was basically previous excercises with different names. I ended up talking to Annabel, the cohort lead, because I was feeling very lost and she told me that all my ideas would work. Seeing the conditions of the project, there was no way around feeling like I ripped off the excercies.

I guess it felt too good to be true!

I did end up trying to complicate things just for the challenge. To my eyes the point of the projects is to push yourself. This being said, I wish I had time to push myself more but my computer decided otherwise. The charger decided to slowly break on me and I had to spend an obnoxious amount of time charging my computer enough for it to reboot properly. Not the most productive I've been..

### Features

Some of the few things that made this project enjoyable was the added features compared to the Sinatra project.

**Omniauth**

Even though Omniauth was challenging it sure was interesting seeing the backside of what is our routine. Everyday we use this feature mindlessly. Even when I spent time thinking about the funtionallity of it I didn't realise it worked this way. Creating a User object and assigning a random password seems more complicated than what I thought it would be. For some reason I thought it wouldn't create a new User object. It seems counter intuitive to have to create a password for our user without their knowledge. 

**Nested Routes**

One that got me thinking alot was using nested routes, I'm not quite sure it fit my project as well as I would've liked. I ended up making some last minuite changes to make it less weird I think. I did end up having less DRY code as a result. I coulndn't find a way to DRY it up without uneccesarly making it more complicated than it needed to be. I'm not happy about that, but I'm running out of time as my computer chager decided to officially die on me and COVID has been delaying all shippings. Lesson learnt: Make sure the stores around you do have a charger for your computer... 

**Scopes**

Another new thing was using scopes. I use plural there but I really only made one. I could've made more but one is enough to understand how it works so I felt there's no use spending my time making more just for the sake of it when I could spend it on things I'm more fuzzy on.

**Git commit -m "Oups I did too many things to explain in a single sentence"**

Even this is not a specific Rails feature, I also enjoyed having to commit often. It was a really fun excercise that I still need practice to master. One concept at a time. I tend to work in a "scattered" way. It's not unorganized, it's just not 'git' oriented, I really need to practice this more often and I'm looking forward to trying again with the next project.

### Hardest part of the project

Even though the whole project was fun, submitting my project is BY FAR the hardest part of any project.
Having to decide "This is it. I cannot make this any better. This is the best I can do." is a hard call. I can't help but see all the areas that need work, to my eyes it is never good enough, I see the potential and want to "fix" it. Obviously I can't spend all the time in the world making the project and have to call it at some point.

Second to last is writting a blog post about my experience. I like to code and ironically I don't like to write. I'm a more logical person and I would be happy to write code alongs, walkthoughs even a user guide. I just don't know what to talk about.

### Potential

Obviously the idea behind a Board Game application wasn't to have a simulation of playing board games but to actually play them. There was a bonus Ruby lab that made us make a Tic Tac Toe game and I was trying to imagine incorperating it to the website.
