## Sinatra to Rails
<p>For most of the Sinatra labs I had a system. I had my notepad++ open and had copied code. All the controllers, routes and even views would be the same from the previous labs so all I needed to do was paste it where it was needed and my lab was pretty much done. Every new lesson I would modify the code in my notepad++ to include the better way</p>
<p>Needless to say it got very redundant and I kept telling myself "There's got to be a better way"</p>
<p>Insert Ruby on Rails!</p>

## All about thoses Macros
<p>These macros have my head spinning. There is so many to choose from! 
My favorite ones so far are the HTML ones. I'm more comftable with OOP languages and being able to use thoses in my HTML files and it automatically generates HTML for me is time saving.</p>
<p>
But are all macros worth it? Everytime I use link_to I'm always baffled I'm swapping a line of code for... a line of code
As for using form macros, yes please! It takes care of all the internal cogs that would just end up being repeted code which isn't very DRY</p>

## How much is too much
<p>It's very tempting to use the biggest generators. It's a time savior, especially if your planning on making something big. But as temting as it seems it can also generate a lot of code you'll never use and it'll be a mess combing through the unused and the used code</p>
<p>Even when using macros correctly it is harder to locate error messages as most of your code is unvisible. It gets confusing to understands who writes what and affects what.</p>

<p>In conclusion: Never overuse macros. Only take what you need. Make sure you know exactly what the macro is going to do before using it.</p>
