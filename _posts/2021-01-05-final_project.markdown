## What to make
One of the hardest parts of these type of projects is deciding what to create. I decided to go simple and work on creating a shopping website.  Simple in idea only, there's a lot of different things to do in a shopping website. A list of products, a cart, a userbase... I thought it would be perfect: I could pick and choose what I needed for the project requirements and  keep updating it in my free time to hopefully make something beautifull.

## In Over My Head
I started working on this project immediately. Unfortunately, when working in retail during the Christmas season, I got more hours in, was physically exhausted and did not find the perfect balance between work and school and myself. Because yes, the dishes still needs to be done, the messes cleaned and the laundry folded. 

I would end up finding the time to work on the project only on my days off instead of when I came home which ultimately meant it took me longer to reach to the "completion" point. Overall the project did not have too many complicated requirements, I was just asking too much of myself. I could have and should have worked on one feature at a time and git commit-ed more often, but I get eager to see it do many things at once.

I want to dazzle with this project and make it do as many things as possible since it is my "Portfolio Project" and forgot for a second that I did not need to do as many things to get this project approved.

## Hard Parts
Weirdly enough, I had a hard time making sense of the Ruby on Rails overkill. I could not understand why and how to connect the frontend to the backend and it took me two days to finally connect the dots. Getting this epiphany feeling of understanding the flow of developing is why Software dev continues to captivate me and I will keep on fighting to become a software developer

Developing is also like a puzzle with many answers and I just love to think through all the different ways to acheive my goal and pick the one I believe is the best option. For example, how do I connect my products to my cart object and then show these products. Do I pass the whole product to the cart or just the product id? On a scale of a small buissness, probably the whole product since it would make it easier to use on the frontend. But on a much bigger scale like Amazon, OfferUp, Facebook Marketplace, I'd rather send less information as possible to help with faster performances .


## WIP
I'm "submitting" this project while it is still under work. It fits all the requirements but it is not finished. I want to keep working on it as a personal challenge and it has been a real learning experience.

I have also been looking into what I would need to do to make it usable to the public in a non commercial way, just out of sheer curiosity, and have found some very intresting API's such as BigCommerce. I would love to get it to work on my website. I do not know if I would be able to because I don't actually own a buisness and won't be selling anything, anytime soon but just playing around and understanding a technology used by professionals doesn't sound like a bad idea
